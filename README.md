# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Classification with EfficientNet

This project applies deep learning to classify brain MRI scans into four categories: **glioma**, **meningioma**, **pituitary tumor**, and **no tumor**. Using the several different model architectures, the models achieves high accuracy through advanced preprocessing, data augmentation, and class balancing techniques.  

The goal is to support medical diagnostics with AI-powered image classification, delivering consistent and interpretable results on complex medical imaging data.
